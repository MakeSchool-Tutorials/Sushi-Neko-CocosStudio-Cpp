In this tutorial we will build Sushi Neko -- a clone of the popular mobile game [Timberman](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/timberman/id871809581?mt=8). We will use the C++ programming language together with Cocos Studio and Cocos2d-x.

Throughout this tutorial you will learn many concepts including how to:

- effectively use Cocos Studio to prototype a game
- use the Cocos2d-x update loop
- create complex animations
- keep the user engaged with seamless menu to game transitions

We'll start off by making a "discrete" version of Timberman. The core gameplay will be present but there will be no fancy animations.

After we finish this basic but playable version we will spend some time polishing up the game. We'll add in a title screen, game over popup and animations.

The solution to this [tutorial is available on GitHub](https://github.com/MakeSchool/SushiNeko-Cpp):

Let's get started with a blank Cocos Studio project!
